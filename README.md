# Integer-not-Float (rust)
I've always wondered how many integers could not be expressed as a float, and which ones.

So, this is a simple rust program that finds them and prints them out.

## To run
Clone or download the repo, `cd` into the folder.

To use `#![feature(step_trait)]` you need nightly, so set anb override using `rustup override set nightly`

Build and run using `cargo run`
